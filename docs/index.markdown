# Getting Started
New users should [watch this introductory video](https://usebeacon.app/videos/welcome_to_beacon) to familiarize themselves with how Beacon works with servers. It'll be well worth the time.

# For Questions Not Answered Here
Beacon has a [Discord server](https://usebeacon.app/discord). Come ask questions, our community usually has somebody with an answer, though remember that people sleep.

If Discord isn't an option, or for private questions such as those about account or purchase issues, please [open a support ticket](https://usebeacon.app/help/contact).

# Bug Reports
Bugs should be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/thommcgrath/Beacon/issues). Anybody can create an account and this is more helpful than email when it comes to bug tracking.
