# Beacon For Ark
An editor for the loot sources in Ark: Survival Evolved.

## Supporting
I don't normally like accept donations, however there will be out-of-pocket costs before the project is finished, such as purchasing signing certificates. So if you'd like to contribute monetarily, you can so do via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZX4EE4YTSP9LS).

## Getting Started
See [https://thezaz.com/beacon/gettingstarted/](https://thezaz.com/beacon/gettingstarted/) for more information on how to get started using Beacon.
