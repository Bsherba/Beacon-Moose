# Beacon For Ark
An editor for the loot sources in Ark: Survival Evolved.

## Supporting
I don't normally like accept donations, however there will be out-of-pocket costs before the project is finished, such as purchasing signing certificates. So if you'd like to contribute monetarily, you can so do via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/thommcgrath).

## Getting Started
See [https://beaconapp.cc/help/gettingstarted.php](https://beaconapp.cc/help/gettingstarted.php) for more information on how to get started using Beacon.

## Roadmap
Beacon is nearing completion. I expect a couple more polish-type builds before final release. The goal is to launch the final version shortly after Ark's launch in August.
